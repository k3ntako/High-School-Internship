# Calculator Project
To tie together some of the things we've worked on over the last several weeks, your job is to complete a calculator app! Some of the basic HTML is already in place (in `index.html`), as well as styling (in `style.css`) – you're responsible for completing the `html` for the operator input, as well as all of the JavaScript (in `index.js`) to make the calculator function properly.

## Requirements
The following features are required to complete a working calculator. While some features might depend on others, think about how you might add one at a time, starting with some simpler ones and working up in complexity.

- When app loads, the display should read "0" (zero)
- The dropdown menu should show the for basic arithmetic operators:
  - addition `+`
  - subtraction `-`
  - multiplication `×` (represented in HTML with `&times;`)
  - division `÷` (represented in HTML with `&divide;`)
- Clicking each number button should add a digit to the number in the display
- Clicking the AC button should clear the display back to "0" (zero)
  - It also deselects any arithmetic operators
- Selecting an operator 
- Clicking the equals button should update the display with the correct result of the operation
