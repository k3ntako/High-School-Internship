# Day 1
Welcome to the internship! We're excited to get started working together – today will mostly be spent talking about how we'll work as a team, and getting started looking at some setup steps.

## Overview
One of the main things we'll focus on for our first meeting will be completing a **team agreement** – a document we'll write together to establish expectations and help us get on the same page as we get started. [Here's the document we'll fill out together.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rKUE3T_gXxl2vj9R1yMyvkQFSLtlkZi_TrGvnaH4paA/edit?usp=sharing)

We'll also talk about how we'll be logging everyone's hours for the internship.
